This project started as a sandbox to learn data science algorithms with a passion backed by my years of security research inspecting telemetry.

More specifically, it arose from a desire to understand the concept by applying mathematics to tease out underlying patterns. Patterns of expectation, such as "The Weak Law of Large Numbers," still blow my mind how this abstract form converges.

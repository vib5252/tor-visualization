&lt;p>A Z-score tells us how many standard deviations a feature’s average (mean) is from the global mean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use this on our top 3 feature combos:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A positive ↑ z-score means the feature has higher than average in the cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A negative ↓ z-score means the feature is lower than average in the cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A low RBM value means that it is familiar to the neural net. It has seen it while training
A high RBM means the neural network is not familiar with this pattern.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principal Component Analysis</title><link>https://vib5252.github.io/tor-visualization/posts/pca/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vib5252.github.io/tor-visualization/posts/pca/</guid><description>&lt;p>PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional linear subspace (eg: 2D) by preserving maximum variance. Used as an input to t-SNE/UMAP to reduce feature noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the PCA analysis of some important features:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="./plots/PCA_HSDir_PCA1_PCA2_08212025.html">HSDir: Hidden Service Directory&lt;/a>
When a Tor relay receives the HSDir flag, it means that the relay acts as a directory node for onion (hidden) services.
The purpose of HSDir is to facilitate the discovery of onion services while preserving anonymity. To receive the HSDir flag, a relay must be stable, have sufficient bandwidth, and usually must have been running for at least 96 hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anomaly Detection and Trust Projection in TOR</title><link>https://vib5252.github.io/tor-visualization/posts/intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vib5252.github.io/tor-visualization/posts/intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project started as a sandbox to learn data science algorithms with a passion backed by my years of security research inspecting telemetry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More specifically, it arose from a desire to understand the concept by applying mathematics to tease out underlying patterns. Patterns of expectation, such as &amp;ldquo;The Weak Law of Large Numbers,&amp;rdquo; still blow my mind how this abstract form converges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/details">TOR public API&lt;/a> gives a rich amount of data that is perfect for exploring latent features. This project explores a pipeline for &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; scoring of TOR relays using a hybrid of unsupervised learning and a final linear classifier.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
